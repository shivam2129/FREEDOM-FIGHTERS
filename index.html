    <h3> Freedom Fighters were those great leaders who sacrificed their lives with fearless courage to bring freedom to the Nation. They are revolutionaries. They faced pain, exploitation, immense torture, and hardships to bring freedom. British ruled over India for more than 200 years. Many Freedom Fighters adopted various ways of fighting against Britishers to attain freedom; some of them used non-violence as a weapon against the Britishers. They did struggle a lot to make India free from Britishers and make it an independent country. The list of Freedom Fighters is endless. Some of them are known while others quietly sacrificed their life for the protection of their motherland. At present, whatever convenience and freedom we got in our life is just because of these freedom fighters. Some famous freedom fighters are Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Mangal Pandey, Rani Laxmi Bai, Subash Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lokamanya Tilak, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Chandra Sekhar, Rajguru, and Sukhdev who sacrificed their lives fighting for their country. Some unsung freedom fighters are Matangini Hazra, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Senapati Bapat, Potti Sreeramulu,  Bhikaji Cama, Tara Rani Srivastava, and Aruna Asaf Ali and many more who have quietly sacrificed for our Nation. India got independence on 15th August 1947. Because of these people, we are celebrating Independence Day. They devoted everything to the progress of the Nation and for its Independence. People considered them as the epitome of patriotic people. Their unimaginable sacrifice, hardships, pain, and hard work get an eternal salute from people.</h3>
